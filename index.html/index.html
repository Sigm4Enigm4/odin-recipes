      <li>Take your low quality beef and I want to lay the smackdown on this wad. Slap it, give it the peoples elbow, talk dirty, fight dirty to it. I want you to beat this meat to be legally considered domestic abuse. It doesn't deserve life, you deserve life, and my balls will supplement you with enough protein that you will literally be able to chisel your muscular contours with a marble pic.
